# IDEA Plugin

If you wish to write contracts in your computer directly, you can get syntax highlighting support inside IntelliJ IDEA thanks to the Confis IDEA plugin.

## Intelligent Editing

The plugin brings the usual commodities of developing inside an IDE, like syntax highlighting, reporting of errors in-the-fly, and autocompletion for contract syntax (`unless`, `asLongAs`) and for contract variables (circumstances, parties, and action names, for example)

## Confis Document Previews

Confis code can be converted to a better-looking [Document](../AgreementsAsDocuments.md). The Document that results from the contract you are writing can be previewed by the Confis Editor provided by the plugin:

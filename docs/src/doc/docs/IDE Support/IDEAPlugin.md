# IDEA Plugin

If you wish to write contracts in your computer directly, you can get syntax highlighting support inside IntelliJ IDEA thanks to the Confis IDEA plugin.

The IDEA plugin brings the usual commodities of developing inside an IDE, like syntax highlighting, reporting of errors in-the-fly, and autocompletion for contract syntax (`unless`, `asLongAs`) and for contract variables (circumstances, parties, and action names, for example)

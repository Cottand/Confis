# Questions

One of the key features of writing legal text as a Confis Agreement is the ability to query the agreement for information, with questions such as _"Is the agreement being complied with?"_ or _"Am I allowed to do X?"_.

There are three kinds of questions that you can ask:

## Compliance Questions
> "After X has happened, is the agreement being complied with, has it been breached, and are there further requirements for it to be complied with?"

**Useful for determining** 
- if you are compliant
- if other parties are compliant
- what you must do in order to comply
- breaches (or possible breaches)

A compliance question only optionally requires a current _state of the world_: a series of past events. A past event is simply a [Sentence](Language/Declarations.md#sentences) possible accompained by the [Circumstances](Language/Circumstances.md) under which it happened.

## Circumstance Questions
> Under what circumstances is X permitted to happen?
 
 **Useful for determining**
- if the contract contains contradictions
- what your legal capabilities are
- what other parties' legal capabilities are

    abstract = {Cryptocurrency mining uses significant amounts of energy as part of the proof-of-work time-stamping scheme to add new blocks to the chain. Expanding upon previously calculated energy use patterns for mining four prominent cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero), we estimate the per coin economic damages of air pollution emissions and associated human mortality and climate impacts of mining these cryptocurrencies in the US and China. Results indicate that in 2018, each $1 of Bitcoin value created was responsible for $0.49 in health and climate damages in the US and $0.37 in China. The similar value in China relative to the US occurs despite the extremely large disparity between the value of a statistical life estimate for the US relative to that of China. Further, with each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefits, absent perpetual price increases. For example, in December 2018, our results illustrate a case (for Bitcoin) where the health and climate change “cryptodamages” roughly match each $1 of coin value created. We close with discussion of policy implications.}

    abstractNote = { &lt;p&gt; Text simplification aims to rewrite text into simpler versions and thus make information accessible to a broader audience (e.g., non-native speakers, children, and individuals with language impairments). In this paper, we propose a model that simplifies documents automatically while selecting their most important content and rewriting them in a simpler style. We learn content selection rules from same-topic Wikipedia articles written in the main encyclopedia and its Simple English variant. We also use the revision histories of Simple Wikipedia articles to learn a quasi-synchronous grammar of simplification rewrite rules. Based on an integer linear programming formulation, we develop a joint model where preferences based on content and style are optimized simultaneously. Experiments on simplifying main Wikipedia articles show that our method significantly reduces the reading difficulty, while still capturing the important content. &lt;/p&gt; }, number = {1}, journal = {Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence},

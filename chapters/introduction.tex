\section{The Hassle of Enterprise Legal Agreements}\label{sec:intro:legal-hassle}

Businesses are routinely bound by legal agreements to each other and those agreements give them constraints with respect to
the legal boundaries they can operate within.
While compliance with the agreement is typically in the interest of all parties involved, it is difficult
to achieve: legal advice - most commonly costly and billed by the hour - must be sought out to
deal with any non-routine situation.

Additionally, even when an agreement is being complied with by all, parties must be able to prove they are compliant,
leading to large amounts of unstructured documents of audit trails.\\

I suggest automating some hassles of legal agreement compliance, audit and verification, by encoding a contract
in a machine-readable format and enable querying it and logging interactions.
The goals are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minimising costs in legal advice by allowing a business to 'ask questions' about the legal boundaries within
    which they are able to operate.
    \item Enabling secure audit trails that all parties involved in the agreement can trust in order to prove
    compliance (or lack thereof!).
\end{itemize}
